1. 
a. If the address did not originate in myalloc(), then it will look at a 
random location in the myalloc() and will delete the information in that 
location. 

b. This case would also result in the same 

c. This will not do anything since my code already released the memory


2.
In order to create a more robust allocator we can use a linked list so 
we can first check if the address exists and if it doesn't then we can 
just throw an error, but if the address does exist then we can easily 
find that memory block and then free() it.
